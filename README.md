This is a random collection of scripts, mostly in Matlab, used for handling medical images and medical image annotations. I used this as a utility library throughout most of my PhD. 

I decided to make this public to facilitate sharing code from my various research projects which make use of it.

There is absolutely no warranty, nor any guarantee of correctness, for any of this software. Neither is there much documentation of the intended function of the code, which may have been forgotten by everyone including its author.

Some of these scripts depend on [SIFT3D](https://github.com/bbrister/SIFT3D) for image reading/writing. Especially the following Matlab functions:
        -imRead3D
        -imWrite3D
